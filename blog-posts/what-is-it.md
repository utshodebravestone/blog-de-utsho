this is blog-de-utsho (utsho's blog). here, i'll write my thoughts, all in lowercase (why? cz i'm weird!). the topic of my post will vary from *philosophy* to *programming*. i hope you enjoy 'em all.

english isn't my first language, so i'll obviously make mistakes. you can correct me if you wish to do so by [submitting a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) in [this repo](https://github.com/utshodebravestone/blog-de-utsho).
