we programer write, read, eat and sleep in *programming languages*. it's our knife and hammer for building amazing things. and thinking goes together with building. this is the ability (to think) that separates us from *ai*. people thinks about stuff not just programmers but where we (programmers) differ from them - we think about weird stuffs. no, no, not just weird; really, really weird. like: what would happen if a programming language only had six instruction to work with? (spoilers: [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)). you already know these if you're a programmer. but do you know how your programming language works? why do you see `hello, world` by writing `console.log("hello, world")`? you know, `console.log` is a *function*, but what is a *function*? how does a *function* get associated with an *object*? how come you can write `function x(): x()` but not `let x = x`? you can read these *how* and *why* in books and stuff but it would be *far more clearer* if you write these behaviour (of *object*, *function* etc.) on your own.

### why?

**why bother writing a programming language?**

if you know how programming languages works, your can work with them more efficiently. and further more, do want the most valuable tool in your toolbox to be a mystery to yourself? (hell, na!)

### how?

**how do i write a programming language?**

i'm glad you asked. i'll tell you but before that, i need to clear out what it means to *write a programming language*.
